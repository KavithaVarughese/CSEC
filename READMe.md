1. Got Blowfish and DES Java implementation from https://www.journaldev.com/1309

2. Tweaked original code to get the encryption and decryption time as output.

3. Compare.py is the main code with the comparison table.

4. Made dummy files with
        mkfile <size> <filaname>
        eg. mkfile 10M 001.xml
    
5.Output of compare.py
